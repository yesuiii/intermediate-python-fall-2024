    "There are several functions you should make to perform this plotting, and you should encapuslate it all in a class called **Plot** that **takes your dataframe as input**. Here are the plotting functions it should have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Box plots of all numeric features** - This function should find all the numeric features in your dataframe and construct a faceted plot (a grid or subplots). Each subplotplot should have the feature labeled and the larger plot should have a title.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single scatter plot of two columns** - This function should take 2 column names and build a scatter plot for them. The axes labels and title should be auto generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scatter matrix with extras** - This function should plot a scatter matrix with histograms plotted along the diagonal. In addition to the scatter matrix, the function should tell which columns were not able to be included in the scatter matrix. \n",
